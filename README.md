<h1 style="font-size:26px; text-align:center;" >Hi, Iâ€™m Anwar ðŸ‘‹</h1> 
I am a passionate full-stack developer on an endless quest to discover and master the latest technologies. 
My journey is fueled by a deep curiosity and a love for learning.
Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and an array of other tools, I approach each project with dedication and a commitment to excellence.

Beyond just building applications, I am drawn to the frontier of Web 3 and open-source collaboration, where I seek to contribute and innovate.
My fascination with blockchain technology is growing, and I am eager to immerse myself further into its new technologies.
